# Asset Naming

First of all, no\ spaces\ on file or directory names.

## Folders

`PascalCase`

Prefer a deep folder structure over having long asset names.

Directory names should be as concise as possible, prefer one or two words. If a directory name is too long, it probably makes sense to split it into sub directories.

Try to have only one file type per folder. Use `Textures/Trees`, `Models/Trees` and not `Trees/Textures`, `Trees/Models`. That way its easy to set up root directories for the different software involved, for example, Substance Painter would always be set to save to the Textures directory.

If your project contains multiple environments or art sets, use the asset type for the parent directory: `Trees/Jungle`, `Trees/City` not `Jungle/Trees`, `City/Trees`. Since it makes it easier to compare similar assets from different art sets to ensure continuity across art sets.

### Debug Folders

`[PascalCase]`

This signifies that the folder only contains assets that are not ready for production. For example, having an `[Assets]` and `Assets` folder.
